As Wordpress became too clunky and difficult to manage, 
we decided to re-build it from scratch and strip all the unnecessary overhead.

What we ended up with was a mobile-first responsive AngularJS single-page website with superfast load time. 
The website was deployed on a linode server that has the lowest configuration and still load very quickly.

Note that as we're not handling heavy traffic or large amount of data, this is meant to be an experiment to benchmark 
how fast a website can load with more content and interaction. As of now we're not at the peak of the possible load speed, but we will continue to experiment and push it to the limits.


Our next goals to enhance this website:

- Change the HTML structure to better serve SEO purpose
- Use tools like prerender.io to prerender the websites for crawlers
- Use app cache to let the page load even when the visitors are offline
- Optimize critical rendering path
- Lazy load heavy components
- Automated testing
