          <h2>Consulting</h2>
          <h4>Understanding your needs</h4>
          <p>First of all, we learn about your business and your project in order to understand your development needs and to determine if KodeQ will be a good fit. If we think we can work together, we’ll work with you to develop a proposal.</p>
          <p>The proposal serves as a broad overview of your software project’s features and a corresponding time and budget estimate</p>

          <h2>Product planning</h2>
          <h4>Creating the right solution</h4>
          <p>Before development begins, we help you plan your software product. We want to make sure we build the most valuable product features first so you don’t waste any money on unnecessary features.</p>

          <h2>Project management</h2>
          <h4>A collaborative workflow</h4>
          <p>At KodeQ, we focus on the larger process of conceptualizing ideas, building workflows, discussing risks, and sketching out solutions. We’re ready to collaborate with you and your in-house staff to solidify a development process that works best for you.</p>
          <h4>Minimizing re-work and increasing understanding</h4>
          <p>Sometimes requirements can be misinterpreted. We try to minimize this by using the right collaboration process and seeking regular feedback. Our weekly retrospective meetings are to make sure that there will never be any surprises, just working software.</p>

          <h2>Development</h2>
          <h4>Building your product</h4>
          <p>We build your product incrementally, one fully-tested and well-designed feature at a time. We add new value to the project at each iteration. Our test-driven development ensures that software is always fully tested.</p>
          <h4>Predictable delivery</h4>
          <p>We use project management tools that allow you to manage the backlog of features alongside with your development team, so you can modify your development priorities any time to meet your business goals. We also inform you about the progress of your software project and the status of your budget.</p>
          <p>Our developers will work with you directly to align expectations and leave little room for surprises, producing overall better quality software and a more transparent working relationship.</p>
